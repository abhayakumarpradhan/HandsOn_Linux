# 1. Understanding "relatime" mount option in /etc/fstab

POSIX family of standarads for OS required that OS must maintain a filesystem metadata that records each time when a file was last accessed, last modified, last changes.

File metadata need to be changed : <ctime, atime,mtime>
Creation Time:
Access Time:
Modification Time:
# doing a write (changing atime) for every READ is dunting. Has implications on efficiency.
It solved by using "relatime" atime is updated when the file is been modified since last atime updated.

#by default in RHEL 6 onwards.
 
$ stat filename.txt #shows the time stamps

$ cat /proc/mounts  #check for mount options "relatime" 

#2. Understanding "barrier" mount option in /etc/fstab

Control JBD (Journalling Block Device). barrier can have two values

1 --> enable
0 --> disable

Filesystem enforce a proper journal commit. It is actually used to reduce the data corruption chances, IN CASE OF POWER FAILURES.

Enabling write barrier means constntly flushing write cache ---  REDUCE PERFORMANCE.

$ cat /proc/mounts  #check for "barrier=1"

$change barrier =0

$ mount -o remount /
