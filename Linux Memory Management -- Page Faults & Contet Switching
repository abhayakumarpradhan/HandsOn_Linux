Mapping of Virtual Address Table ---> Memory (Primary)
Usage of swap memory in HDD

# Page Faults

1. Minor Pgae fault : data is in RAM but the process doesn't know the page address
2. Major Page fault : data in storage / swap but not in RAM i.e. loading data using swap-in & swap-out (involve Disk I/O)

*** when OS access the process first time -- requires more CPU cycle & Major Page Faults happen

*** For accessing 2nd time onwards -- Minor Page Faults

$ free -w   #check for user & cache

$/usr/bin/time -v cal  # check for Major PF & Minor PF

$ free -w   #check for user & cache (increased)

$ /usr/bin/time -v cal  # check for Major PF & Minor PF & % of CPU used

*** Also refer context switching. (invol. CS -- for disk I/O or arrival of High Priority Process)
