# rsnapshot - Remote File System Snapshot
- Backup remote Linux servers using rsync over ssh
- Local snapshots are handled by rsync
- Remote snapshots are handled by rsync over ssh
- It can take incremental snapshots of local & remote file systems for any number of machines.
- It saves HDD space to a great extent. If a file doesn't change then the next snapshot will create a hadlink to the same file.
Process :

1. Download rsnapshot from repo
2. Prepare your server for password less authentication using ssh on remote serve
r using ssh-keygen -t dsa command & send key to the remote server using ssh-copy
-id command.
3. Edit the /etc/snapshot.conf file
4. Check the rsnapshot config using rsnapshot configtest command.
5. Use the crontab for taking backup at regular intervals.
 
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
$ ssh-copy-id -i id_dsa.pub root@10.5.0.88
$ ssh 10.5.0.88 # password less authentication
$ vim /etc/snapshot.conf

uncomment cmd_rsync	/usr/bin/rsync
add backup	root@10.5.0.88/etc	myserver-etc/ #folder-name

$rsnapshot configtest

$ where is rsnapshot #bin path
$/usr/bin/rsnapshot hourly

Now check your backups under the hidden folder .snapshots/
