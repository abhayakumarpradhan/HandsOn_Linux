# SCP vs RSYNC

SCP - plain linear copy

demo.txt 1 GB fle from Machine A --------- Machine B
edited the same file and added few data.

demo.txt size = 1.5 GB

now if you copy demo.txt from A to B

Then it will copy the entire file rewrite the complete file. (not only updated portion but the complete file)

# which is redundant in nature. 

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=2M count=500
$ scp bigfile abhaya@10.5.0.88
$ echo "edited file & added a new file" >> bigfile
$ /usr/bin/time -v scp bigfile abhaya@10.5.0.88
# now it will again start from 0%.

Check for User time & System time ?


# RSYNC is efficient and does DELTA COPY (Changes only copied)
# uses DELTA Tranfer Algorithm

$ rsync -p bigfile abhaya@10.5.0.88
$ echo "lets do some changes to the bigfile" >> bigfile
$ /usr/bin/time -v rsync bigfile abhaya@10.5.0.88
